### About

***cute*** is a cross-platform CLI tool that brings several advanced features and capabilities including bulk operations, web server mode, AI generation and language translation to working with your content hosted on [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com).

### Key Features

- *Download*, modify and *upload* data to your Contentful space in popular formats like Comma delimited files (CSV), Tab delimited files (TSV), MS-Excel workbooks (XLSX), Javascript Object Notation (JSON) and YAML.
- Perform *Bulk operations* on your content with support for publish/unpublish, edit, search & replace and delete actions.
- Input data can be sourced and synced from many external sources including flat files, databases, webAPIs, your Contentful space and other popular sources like [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/).
- *Generate content* from scratch using [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/api/) GPT and reasoning models with comprehensive prompt configuration support.
- Support for *content translation* using popular AI translation services like [Google Translation UI](https://cloud.google.com/translate), [Azure AI Translator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-translator), [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
- Deploy ***cute*** as a *Web Server* in `scheduler` or `webhooks` mode with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) logging and a service terminal to reflect health, configuration and scheduled tasks.
- Support for *structural subtyping* through the `typegen` command option which exports TypeScript (TS) interface declarations. This feature is especially useful to keep your JavaScript or .NET projects in sync with your content types.
- Interact with ***Douglas***, cute's very own AI assistant that will answer questions about your content, or even help formulate queries to interact with your content.
