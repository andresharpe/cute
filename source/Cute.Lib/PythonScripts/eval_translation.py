    (see https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alavie/METEOR/pdf/Lavie-Agarwal-2007-METEOR.pdf) is a metric for the evaluation of MT output. 
    The metric is based on the harmonic mean of unigram precision and recall, with recall weighted higher than precision. 
    It also has several features that are not found in other metrics, such as stemming and synonymy matching, along with 
    the standard exact word matching. The metric was designed to fix some of the problems found in the more popular BLEU metric, 
    and also produce good correlation with human judgement at the sentence or segment level. This differs from the BLEU metric 
    in that BLEU seeks correlation at the corpus level. The METEOR metric ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match.

    Proposed by Yonghui Wu et al (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08144v2.pdf), the GLEU metric is calculated by recording all 
    sub-sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 tokens in the output and target sequences (n-grams). Then, the authors compute a recall, 
    which is the ratio of the number of matching n-grams to the number of total n-grams in the target (ground truth) sequence, 
    and a precision, which is the ratio of the number of matching n-grams to the number of total n-grams in the 
    generated output sequence. The GLEU metric is simply the minimum of recall and precision. 
    This GLEU metric's range is always between 0 (no matches) and 1 (all match) and it is symmetrical when switching output and 
    target. GLEU metric correlates quite well with the BLEU metric on a corpus level but does not have its drawbacks per sentence 
    reward objective.
